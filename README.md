# Globetrotter's Gallery

## Description

Globetrotters Gallery is a platform designed to inspire and guide travelers through a community-driven collection of past travel experiences. 

Our motivation stems from the common challenge faced by travelers â€“ the lack of firsthand insights into destinations. We believe that personal recommendations from fellow globetrotters can significantly enhance the travel planning experience.

We built Globetrotters Gallery to create a centralized space where individuals can connect with peers, share their past travel experiences, and discover hidden gems and recommendations for their next adventure. Unlike other platforms, our focus is on fostering a sense of community and trust, ensuring that the travel suggestions come from real experiences.

The platform addresses the issue of inadequate personalisation when planning a trip. By providing a collection of curated travel itineraries, reviews, and landmarks shared by fellow globetrotters, users can make more informed decisions about their travel destinations and activities. And even copy the itinerary completely.

Throughout the development of Globetrotters Gallery, we learned valuable lessons in community-driven platforms, user engagement, and the significance of user-generated content. We delved into the complexities of account management, data filtering, and multimedia storage to create a comprehensive and user-friendly travel inspiration hub.
